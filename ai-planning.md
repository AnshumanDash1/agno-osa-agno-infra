# Web Browser Phaser Game
You are going to make a web browser game through phaser. The game will be similar to Clash Royale in that you have an elixir bar at the bottom, and there are cards that you can play. But the similarities end there.

### Basic Starting point
There is a character on the screen that is controlled by the player through WASD movement keys. But to attack or do something, the player must play a "card" which will cost varying levels of elixir. The elixir bar is always filling up, so there is no need to save elixir at any point. A simple fireball attack, for instance, could cost 1 elixir and just be a simple red ball shooting away from the player.

### Enemies
The player should be surrounded by enemies that slowly come and attack the player, but strafe around him. When they attack the player, the player's health bar shown on top should go down a little. This should be a green health bar.

### other cards - advanced implementation
Other cards that the player can play are shield, where the player puts down a wall in front of him, a summon, where the player summons a skeleton to  fight for him, and goo, where the player throws goo in front of him to slow down the enemy. The goo can also be lit on fire by the fireball ability.

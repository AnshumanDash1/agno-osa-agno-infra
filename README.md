It is an AI agent created through Agno, and controls the browser via playwright commands.
The llm decides which tools to call, all predefined via playwright code.

## Short Term Roadmap
- Making the email pipeline work
- Making youtube pipeline work

## Long Term Roadmap
- Livekit integration so that the user can just talk to navigate the web
- Agno exposed as an mcp for easy integration into Livekit
- Making this happen locally on a rasberry pi so that I can power user chats via a gpu setup instead of using up Ai credits
